# This playbook can be used to redeploy all chacra nodes without disrupting the CI.
# It check Jenkins to make sure there are no running jobs either POSTing or planning to POST binaries to each chacra node before proceeding
#
# Prerequisites:
#  - Be using ceph-sepia-secrets ansible inventory
#  - Have an individual playbook file for each node named {{ inventory_hostname }}.yml
#  - Have no need to pass additional vars on the command-line
#    (e.g., `ansible-playbook 1.chacra.ceph.com.yml` should be sufficient)
